      text: |
        This is a second level course in epidemiologic methods. This course focuses on 
        methods used in the design and conduct of observational epidemiologic studies. 
        The emphasis is placed on the different types of study designs, selected analytical 
        methods, identification and avoidance of biases and confounding, examination of 
        data for interactions, and concepts of causation.
